The SpeedWidget is an Android widget designed to display the current speed in real-time on the home page of your Android device. This widget provides users with a convenient way to monitor their current speed without the need for a separate app.

## Structure

### SpeedService

The `SpeedService` is a component of the SpeedWidget that implements the `IBaseGpsListener` interface to obtain the current speed information. This service is responsible for interacting with the device's GPS system and retrieving the real-time speed data.

### SpeedAppWidget

The `SpeedAppWidget` is the main component that brings the SpeedWidget to life. It starts the `SpeedService` as a foreground service, ensuring that the speed monitoring continues even when the widget is not actively displayed. This widget updates both the image and text elements based on the current information obtained from the `SpeedService`.
